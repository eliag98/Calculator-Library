# Calculator-Library
Importable File with some functions that can perform basic arithmetic operations including +, -, *, / so any programmer can download and include your file to start using its functions.

# How to use this library
First you have to put the folder in the same folder of your script
Then you'll have to import the folder and the file
==> from CalcLib import calculator
Then if you want to use functions inside you just have to use them like this
calculator.addition(x1, x2) | calculator.subtraction(y1, y2) and so on.
The functions will return the result so you have to print() it.
I will provide a test file with the script.
